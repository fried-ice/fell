# FELL - the Furious shELL

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/fried-ice/fell/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fried-ice/fell/actions)


## Overview
Fell is a simple shell programm.  
I use it to aproach Linux API and C basics and understand the usage of GNU Automake and CMake build systems.  
It is **not** supposed to deliver every day usage shell experience.
Man pages are generated by pandoc via Markdown.

This program is most likely filled with bugs and security problems, so use it at your own risk.

**fell** currently supports the following features:

 * **cd** *path:* Switch current working directory (relative or absolute).

* **exit**: Close the shell.

* **programm**: Execute a binary program in the $PATH.

* **path/to/programm**: Execute a binary programm (relative or absolute).

* The current working directory is displayed at the beginning of each input line.

## Build instructions
Build using either GNU Automake:
```shell
./prepare.sh (only when cloning from git, not when using the release tarball)
./configure
make
make install
```

 or CMake:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

Enable verbose printing inside the program by using
```
./configure CPPFLAGS=-DVLEVEL=[0|1|2|3]
```
instead of the normal configure invocation.

## Packaging
As i like to learn more about packaging for several GNU/Linux Distributions, there will be some Package Builds.

As of the time of writing, there is an Arch Linux PackageBuild ready for use (git and release).
